# CV

This is just my CV. Nothing fancy :-).

# How it's done

It's just some Latex using the ModernCV template.

# How to produce PDF?

You need the packages `make`, `texlive` and `texlive-latex-extra` and probably some more Latex packages.

Then you just need to run the `./compile.sh`

When you want to clean, just run `make very-clean`
